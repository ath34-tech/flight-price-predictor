 # Flight Price Predictor

## Overview

The **Flight Price Predictor** is a web application built with Flask that predicts flight prices based on various parameters such as airline, source and destination cities, departure and arrival times, stops, and flight class. This project leverages machine learning techniques to provide users with an estimate of flight prices, helping them make informed travel decisions.
## Why I Created This?

I created this project to showcase my knowledge of developing a simple linear regression model and deploying it for real-world use cases. It demonstrates my ability to integrate machine learning into a web application, providing a practical solution for predicting flight prices.

## Features

- User-friendly interface to input flight details
- Machine learning model trained on flight pricing data
- Beautiful and responsive design
- Integration with Unsplash API for dynamic background images
- Frosted glass effect for a modern and stylish look

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Deployment**: Render
- **API Integration**: Unsplash API for background images
